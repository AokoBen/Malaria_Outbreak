Malaria is a life-threatening disease worldwide as the leading cause of illness and death, which, however, lacks comprehensive documentation on its incidence both at the national and county levels in Kenya. There is need to develop systems that capture national and regional trends of malaria incidence, infection, and outbreak, to provide tailored intervention for prevention, monitoring of possible outbreak of malaria, and provision of mitigative measures against devastating effects of malaria in Kenya.
According to 2021 World Malaria Report, Malaria is one of the most severe public health problems worldwide, especially in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, where young children who have not developed immunity to malaria and pregnant women whose immunity has been decreased by pregnancy are most affected. Nearly half the world’s population live in areas at risk of malaria transmission in 87 countries and territories. 
In 2020, malaria caused an estimated 241 million clinical episodes, and 627,000 deaths. Africa being the most affected due to a combination of factors such as:
•	Predominant and efficient mosquito parasite species Plasmodium falciparum responsible for high transmission and cause severe malaria and deaths.
•	Favorable local weather conditions which allow both vector and parasite development, and encourage malaria parasite transmission to occur year-round.
•	Scarce resources and socio-economic instability which hinder efficient malaria control interventions.
Malaria surveillance is therefore, a core component of an effective system to support malaria elimination. 
Surveillance will not only enable countries to monitor progress towards elimination of malaria and develop targeted interventions for at-risk groups, but also boot efforts towards early detection of malaria outbreak and trigger a prompt response to malaria epidemics to minimise the impact of the illness including deaths and the socio-economic burden of malaria epidemics for at-risk groups and regions of the population.
 Early of malaria outbreak This app is primed to assist public health workers in their effort to detect possibility of an early outbreak of malaria and line up appropriate intervention measures to mitigate the risks associated with an outbreak of the disease.
